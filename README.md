This repository contains a simple JavaScript program that demonstrates a common error in while loops: incorrect loop condition. The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version.

The bug is caused by a mistake in the loop condition, which can lead to an infinite loop or unexpected behavior.

The solution demonstrates how to correct the condition to ensure the loop runs as intended.
